# SafeGuard Crawler

> Early signals, safer spaces

SafeGuard Crawler is an ethical, automated monitoring pipeline that surfaces **early-warning signals of online harm** in Kenyan digital spaces, with a strong focus on **GBV-related abuse, cyber-harassment, and misinformation**.

It is built for **digital-safety NGOs, newsroom moderators, GBV helpline responders, and campus safety officers**, giving them a **4–6 hour head start** to act before harm escalates.

## Key Idea

> Safe, context-aware AI can close the detection gap between when harm starts and when humans finally see it.

SafeGuard Crawler:

- Scrapes **only permitted public sources** while respecting `robots.txt` and platform policies  
- Runs **multilingual NLP** tuned for **English, Kiswahili, and Sheng**  
- Detects **harmful threads and narratives early** using topic modeling, NER, sentiment & burst detection  
- Sends **explainable alerts** to responders via a dashboard and notifications  
- Protects users via **PII redaction, pseudonymization, encryption, and short retention windows**
